# DL-with-PyTorch

PyTorch is a great Deep Learning library that makes it easy for the user to experiment with D.L. related concepts such as: CNNs, CUDA, backpropagation, and Loss functions

However, users may come to find that although abstractions of common D.L. operations make it easy for the user to implement, it may take away meaning from what is actually happening under the hood.

Hence, this introductory tutorial will teach the user how to implement standard Neural Network operations and generalize how to integrate any custom function in PyTorch

## Framework

The tutorials will build one concept at a time. For the specified concept, we will manually implement the operation using PyTorch capabilities, but will implement other needed operations using PyTorch's inherent capabilities to simplify code. 

The following are below concepts that have been manually been created on PyTorch

##### Gradient Descent

* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Newton's Method

##### Linear Operations

* Linear layer
* Convolutional Layer
* Spectral Convolution

##### Activation Methods

* Activation methods

##### Analyzing Distinct Data Domains

* Spatial data
* Non-Euclidean data
